## Project 1 : Vaccination App

### Part 1 : Vaccination App
Developed an app that receives, processes, record and answers questions on whether a citizent is vaccinated or not.
The basic goal of the project is that the app uses the following datastractures in order to handle the data and operate on question answering:
  - [Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)
  - [Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)
  - Hash Tables, Linked Lists, etc.

### Part 2 : Bash Script
Created a bash script that generates test files for the Vaccination App (Part 1).
The script takes as input:
  - virusesFile: a file with viruses names (one per line)
  - countriesFile: a file with countries names (one per line)
  - numLines: number of lines of the output file that will be generated
  - duplicatesAllowed: if 0, citizenIDs must be unique, if 1 dulpicate citizenIDs are allowed
