## Project 3 : Travel Monitor v2
Goal of this project is to familiarize with:
  - Thread creation
  - Network Programming using sockets

Modified the Travel Monitor App of Project 2, in order to use Threads and the communication is performed over sockets.
The functionality remains the same. Main differences are that the communication over pipes is replaced with socket communication and the input file parsing is performed by a number of threads.
